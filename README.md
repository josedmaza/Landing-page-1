# Landing Page Project 

## About this proyect

this is my landing proyect page readme.
The main purpose of this project is put in practice the content learned during the "Javascript and the DOM" section of the Front-end developer Nanodegree by Udacity.


## The languages used

- Html
- Css
- Javascript

## The Functionalities

- By Clicking on a navigation item the page scrolls to the appropriate section of the page.
- While navigating through the page, the section that is active in the viewport to the top is distinguished from the other sections.
- It uses javascript to dynamically create navbar links based on the content, when a section is in view it show the active state of that section.
